The  following \gdauts{} written with the .NET framework are supported:

\begin{itemize}
\item You must be using Windows XP or higher.
\item We have performed our tests on a WinForms \gdaut{} in .NET version 4.0. Although tests may be also be executable with .NET 3.5 (or even lower), the minimum supported version is .NET 4.0.
\item \gdauts{} that are not written with WinForms or WPF (e.g. Win32, etc.) are not supported in the current version. 
\end{itemize}
