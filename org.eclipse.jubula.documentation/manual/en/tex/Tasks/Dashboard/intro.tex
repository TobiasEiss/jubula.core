The \dash{} is a web application that allows you to view test results from within a browser. You can only see test results which are still in the \gddb{} \bxpref{TasksReopenTestResult}. If you still wish to see test results after a \gddb{} migration, then you should ensure that the old \gddb{} instance and  a \dash{} in the correct version remain installed so that older test results can be read. 

\subsubsection{The \dash{} server}
In the installation directory, in the folder \bxname{dashboard}, you will find the \bxname{dashboardserver}. 

When this server is started, it receives configuration information for the 
\gddb{} you will be connected to via the browser. 

For information on starting the server, refer to the later section \bxpref{TasksDashCustom}. The \dash{} can also be started with default parameters and with automatic browser opening. See the section on using the \dash{} locally for more information \bxpref{TasksDashDefault}.

The workspace directory for the \dash{} is in your home directory under:\\
\bxname{.guidancer/dashboardWorkspace}

\subsection{Starting the \dash{} application in the browser}
Once the \dash{} server has been started, you can start the \dash{} application in the browser. This happens automatically if you are using the \bxname{dashboard} application \bxpref{TasksDashDefault}, or you can enter a URL to start the web application and connect to the server you started \bxpref{TasksDashConnect}.
