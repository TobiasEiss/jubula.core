You can close the browser to stop viewing the \dash{} at any time. This does not, however, stop the \dash{} server. 

If you are using the \dash{} application \bxpref{TasksDashDefault} you can stop the \dash{} server by right-clicking on the system tray icon and selecting \bxcaption{Exit}. 

If you started the \dash{} server \bxpref{TasksDashCustom}, then you can stop the \dash{} server by killing the process.
